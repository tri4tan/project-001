# project-001

This repository is a simple test project for getting familiar with the Codex-based workflow.
It contains only a minimal README so you can practice running commands, editing files, and
creating commits and pull requests within the environment.

## Getting Started

1. Make your changes locally inside this repository.
2. Use Git commands to stage and commit your modifications.
3. Run any necessary tests or checks as you experiment with the tooling.

Feel free to modify this README or add new files as you explore the workflow.
